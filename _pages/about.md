I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at University of Southern California. I am fortunately to be mentored by Prof. <a href='https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~liu32/'>Yan Liu</a>.

My goal is to help the state-of-the-art generative models gentle into the human society without bringing in sudden negative impacts. Currently, I focus on the security, privacy, and trustworth of diffusion models. I am also interesting in making foundation models and AI applications more efficiently and accessible to the public.
