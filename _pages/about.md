[//]: Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at University of Southern California. I am fortunate to work with Prof. <a href='https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~liu32/'>Yan Liu</a>.

My goal is to help the state-of-the-art generative models gentle into the human society without bringing in sudden negative impacts. Currently, I focus on the building scalable models for time series and making generative models more controllable..
