I am currently a graduate student in Computer Science at University of Southern California. My goal is to make state-of-the-art generative models truly beneficial to the society. Currently, I focus on the trustworthy and copyright concerns of diffusion models. Meanwhile, I am building scalable methods for augmenting diffusion models and LLM in real-world applications.
